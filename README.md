## 👋 Hey, I’m Shane

Former high school underachiever. Current Python mercenary.  
Once failed math exams, now I’m writing, tuning YOLO detectors, and explaining models like bedtime stories.

- 🎓 M.S. in Data Science @ Boston University  
- 🛠 Working at a startup doing industrial defect detection – real models, real products, real deadlines  
- 💻 I write scripts that actually get used (sometimes by people who don’t even know what a terminal is)  
- 📈 I treat Leetcode like a gym: 300 reps, form over volume  
- 🧠 Favorite algorithm: BFS. Favorite career strategy: also BFS – try every path, backtrack when needed

> I’m not here to impress you with a thousand starred repos.  
> I’m here because I know how to build, how to ship, and how to not quit when shit breaks.

### 💼 Open to Work

Actively looking for opportunities as a:
- 🧠 Data Scientist
- 📊 Data Analyst
- 🤖 Machine Learning Engineer
- 💻 Software Engineer

> Give me one chance and I’ll lock on like a crocodile. I don’t let go until it’s done.


### 🔍 Currently working on:
- A recommendation plugin that doesn’t just echo what you’ve already clicked  
- Prompt optimization workflows (because ChatGPT deserves better instructions)  
- Making every Python script I write useful enough to be used by someone non-technical — then sellable

### 💬 Philosophy:
> If I can make something useful with just Python and a Google Doc,  
> Maybe you don’t need Kubernetes for your MVP.
