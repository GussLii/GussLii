# 👋 Hey, I’m Shane

Former high school underachiever. Current Python mercenary.  
Once failed math exams.  
Now I compose, tune, and explain models like bedtime stories.  
Not listing models. Just know they work—and I can tell you why.

## 💼 Open to Work

Actively looking for opportunities as a:
- 🧠 Data Scientist
- 📊 Data Analyst
- 🤖 Machine Learning Engineer
- 💻 Software Engineer

> Give me one chance and I’ll lock on like a crocodile. I don’t let go until it’s done.

## ⚒️ Currently Working On

- A recommendation plugin that doesn't just echo what you’ve already clicked  
- Prompt optimization workflows (because ChatGPT deserves better instructions)  
- Turning scripts into tools even non-tech folks can use—and maybe pay for

## 💻 Tech Stack I Actually Use

**Languages / Core**
- Python (for real things, not notebooks that never get deployed)
- JavaScript / Node.js
- C++ (because sometimes Python’s speed is absolute garbage and someone needs to get things done)

**Web / Backend**
- Express.js  
- MongoDB + Mongoose  
- RESTful APIs  
- FastAPI (because it just works)

**Data & Infra**
- SQL (I eat window functions for breakfast)  
- Kafka (yes, I can stream that)  
- MapReduce (because not everything fits in memory)
- Apache Spark (batch + streaming, tuned for memory and job failure recovery) 

**Also Touched**
- Redis, Docker, Streamlit, Jira...

> If it breaks, I can fix it.  
> If it needs to scale, I know where the bottlenecks are.

## 🧠 Models I’ve Played With 

CNN got hot, I handled vision.  
LSTM stuck around, I tuned sequence.  
YOLO split tiles, I ran detections.  
GARCH waved noise, I forecast tension.

XGBoost like potions, I tweaked for days,  
Transformers I narrate like bedtime phase.  
BERT still lives—gets the job done,  
LightGBM? Clean, precise, fun.

GAN? No paper, but I’ve broken it.  
Recommendation? Simulated hits.  
Language models? Not for tweets—  
I use them to make broken things speak.

So don’t ask which model I’ve used.  
Ask what problem you’ve got—I’ll choose.

## ⛓️ Blockchain (No longer mystified, still fascinated)

I used to believe blockchain was a pure decentralized ideal.  
Then I watched Bitcoin tank when the Fed raised rates 0.25%.  
Now I study blockchains not as rebellion tools, but as imperfect systems shaped by very real power, liquidity, and narrative cycles.

### 🛠️ What I’ve Actually Built
- Simulated a local Bitcoin-style internal network: public/private key generation, UTXO-style transactions, and tracking logic  
- Implemented core cryptographic primitives: Merkle Trees, CBC, ECDSA-style digital signatures  
- Played with MPC and consensus mechanisms—not at scale, but structurally grounded  
- Wrote all this not to mint NFTs, but to understand why distributed systems stay up when no one trusts each other

> I don’t see crypto as freedom tech anymore.  
> I see it as a fascinating experiment in trust design—still broken in parts, still worth fixing.

### 💬 Philosophy:
> If I can make something useful with just Python and a Google Doc,  
> Maybe you don’t need Kubernetes for your MVP 🤡.
